# Security Prioritizer

This skill enables Gemini CLI to act as a security analyst by correlating vulnerability data from multiple sources (Tenable, Wiz, CISA KEV, phpIPAM) to provide a prioritized action report.

## Prerequisites

- PostgreSQL MCP server connected with the following tables:
  - `public.tenable_findings`
  - `public.tenable_assets`
  - `public.tenable_asm_assets`
  - `public.wiz_vulnerabilities`
  - `public.wiz_inventory`
  - `public.cisa_kev`
  - `public.phpipam_assets`

## Workflows

### Generating a Prioritization Report

When asked to prioritize findings or generate a risk report:

1.  **Load Logic**: Reference [references/logic.md](references/logic.md) for the prioritization scoring system and SQL query.
2.  **Execute Query**: Use the `mcp_postgresql_execute_sql` tool to run the query.
3.  **Synthesize Results**: Present the top results (usually top 10-20) with a clear explanation of why they are prioritized (e.g., "This CVE is in CISA KEV and is externally visible").

## Scoring Model

- **Base**: CVSS Score (0-10)
- **CISA KEV**: +100
- **External Visibility (ASM)**: +50
- **Cross-Tool Confirmation**: +20

## Example Requests

- "Give me the top 10 security findings I should work on today."
- "Show me all CISA KEV vulnerabilities that are externally visible."
- "Correlate Tenable and Wiz findings to see what's confirmed by both."
